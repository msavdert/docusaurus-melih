# About these notes

These are some notes regarding things I have learned.

Each note will provide a summary of the most important points regarding the topic. This is useful for getting a higher-level understanding or refreshing your memory. If you want more details, you can use the resources at the end of the note as a curated list of resources.

The actual notes are versioned in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/msavdert/docusaurus-melih) . This website is generated from those notes using the lovely [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)  plus a bunch of custom scripts that are also in the repository. The generated site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)  and search is powered by [Algolia's DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) . Analytics are collected using the privacy-friendly [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) .
